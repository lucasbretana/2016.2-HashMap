TO DO:
[x] Finish main
[ ] The HashMap itself needs to alocate memory deferently depending on the mehod
    If the method is the chaining, the insted of a key_t ** it needs a list of key_t **
    My initial thougth was to use a void *, but I need a key_t **, so a create a key_p (aka: key_t *)
    so the hash struct can have a void * that could lead to a node_t * or a key_p (aka: key_t *)
[ ] Implement the GET function
->[ ] The search mechanism needs to be adaptative about the method used
[ ] Implement the DELETE function
